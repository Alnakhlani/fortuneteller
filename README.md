#fortune teller program

User gives some information about themselves and the program tells their fortune.

REMEMBER: There is no right answer!!!! If your code meets the program requirements, then it works.

## Concepts
- different types of input and arguments
- variable types (string, integer, float, boolean)
- conditionals (if/else statements)
- case statements (https://www.blackbytes.info/2015/10/ruby-case/)

## Program Requirements
1. User can enter their name and program responds, "Hi, [user name]"

2. User can input age and program repeats information
*discuss difference between string, integer and float

3. User can decide whether or not they want their fortune told and program responds
*discuss boolean

4. If user decides to have their fortune told, program begins asking for a few details (you decide which questions)
*discuss conditionals

5. Depending on these details, program tells them a fortune

6. Play with your code and make the combinations more complex
*discuss 'case statements' (https://www.blackbytes.info/2015/10/ruby-case/)
